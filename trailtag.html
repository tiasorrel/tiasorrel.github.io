        <h1>TrailTag</h1>
        <p>TrailTag is a personal location device that allows groups on outdoor trips to communicate with each other and send out distress signals. With my small team of developers and designers, I worked on the UX/UI design of the corresponding mobile app for both Android and iOS.</p>

  <div class="row margin-bottom">
      <div class="col-xl-3 col-xl-offset-2 col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-1 padding-right">
      <p>There are certain risks that come along with outdoor trips, especially in isolated areas. If a member of the group gets separated, it can be extremely difficult to contact or locate them. TrailTag offers people peace of mind by keeping groups connected even without reliable cell service. The group membersâ€™ locations can constantly be viewed by the other members in the app, and distress signals can be sent out to the group if anyone is ever in danger. With TrailTag, trip goers can have a more positive experience, as they will feel safer to always be connected with their group.</p>

  <div class="col-xl-3 col-xl-offset-2 col-sm-5 padding-right more-space-bottom-xs">
      <p>While designing the app, it was very important to focus on making it extremely intuitive, since it would be used in active, and potentially stressful or dangerous, situations. Additionally, many people go into nature to remove themselves from technology, so both the app and the personal location device needed to remain unobtrusive&mdash;there when you need it, but otherwise wouldn't demand attention.</p></div>

      <h3>Research Phase</h3>
      <p>At the beginning of the project, we had a 3-week research period in which we could familiarize ourselves with the product, conduct user interviews and surveys, decide on the target audience, and determine the scope of the project.</p>

      <p><b>Competitive Audit<br></b>
      In our research, we wanted to decide which particular use cases would be best to design for due to our time constraints, so I researched competitors in the location tracking space. TrailTag holds a unique patent, making it stand out from its competitors, but we wanted to find out exactly what things it did better than these other products. I placed the competitors into a few main groups and explained TrailTag's competitive edge.</p>

        <ol>
        <li><b>Cell-Based</b>: Requires cell service so it can't be used reliably in nature.</li>
        <li><b>Bluetooth connection</b>: (ex. Tile) The range is only about 100ft, so it wouldn't help if someone was separated from their group.</li>
        <li><b>Satellite</b>: Satellite devices are really expensive, don't have reliable service, and aren't made for local group communication.</li>
        <li><b>Off Grid Communication</b>: (ex. GoTenna) This requires the cell phone to be turned on, so it is useless if the phone dies (which may happen in long trips or in cold weather).</li>

      <p><b>Target Audience Research<br></b>
      As a team, we worked a lot on the whiteboard during our meetings. We created user flows for each of the actors and decided which features were necessary for a MVP. A specific challenge that came up was how we wanted to design the prospective student-host pairing system. Many questions arose: <em>Should the prospective student be able to see all of the hosts at a college? How much information should be on their profiles? Would prospective students rather find their perfect host and schedule a visit according to the host's available dates, or find a host based on their availability?</em></p>
