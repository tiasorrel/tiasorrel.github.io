        <h1>TrailTag</h1>
        <p>TrailTag is a personal location device that allows groups on outdoor trips to communicate with each other and send out distress signals. With my small team of developers and designers, I worked on the UX/UI design of the corresponding mobile app for both Android and iOS.</p>

      <div class="col-xl-4 col-xl-offset-2 col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-1 padding-right">
      <p>There are certain risks that come along with outdoor trips, especially in isolated areas. If a member of the group gets separated, it can be extremely difficult to contact or locate them. TrailTag offers people peace of mind by keeping groups connected even without reliable cell service. The group membersâ€™ locations can constantly be viewed by the other members in the app, and distress signals can be sent out to the group if anyone is ever in danger.</p>
      </div>

  <div class="col-xl-4 col-sm-5 padding-right more-space-bottom-xs">
      <p>While designing the app, it was very important to focus on making it extremely intuitive, since it would be used in active, and potentially stressful or dangerous, situations. Additionally, many people go into nature to remove themselves from technology, so both the app and the personal location device needed to remain unobtrusive&mdash;there when you need it, but otherwise wouldn't demand attention.</p></div>

        <h3>Research Phase</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of the project, we had a 3-week research period in which we could familiarize ourselves with the product, conduct user interviews and surveys, decide on the target audience, and determine the scope of the project.</p>
      </div>

      <p><b>Competitive Audit<br></b>
      In our research, we wanted to decide which particular use cases would be best to design for due to our time constraints, so I researched competitors in the location-tracking space. TrailTag holds a unique patent, making it stand out from its competitors, but we wanted to find out exactly what things it did better than these other products. I placed the competitors into a few main groups and explained TrailTag's competitive edge.</p>

        <ol>
        <li><b>Cell-Based</b>: Requires cell service so it can't be used reliably in nature.</li>
        <li><b>Bluetooth connection</b>: (ex. Tile) The range is only about 100ft, so it wouldn't help if someone was separated from their group.</li>
        <li><b>Satellite</b>: Satellite devices are really expensive, don't have reliable service, and aren't made for local group communication.</li>
        <li><b>Off Grid Communication</b>: (ex. GoTenna) This requires the cell phone to be turned on, so it is useless if the phone dies (which may happen in long trips or in cold weather).</li>

      <p>
      Next, we wanted to figure out which activities and sports TrailTag would be most useful for. I researched companies that led guided outdoor group trips and their safety protocol and current methods of communication (if any) to determine if they would benefit from adopting TrailTag. Activities with extremely small group sizes, such as heli skiing and snowmobiling, were not viable target customers because of the negligent risk of group separation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class= "col-xl-4 col-sm-5 padding-right">
      <p>However, with guided hiking and outdooor expedition trips, the group sizes would often be significantly larger. Sometimes larger groups would split up into smaller groups, each accompanied by a guide. Communication between each of the smaller groups would be highly beneficial in order to coordinate in case of change of plans. In our user interviews, we continued to dig in to see which scenarios TrailTag could be best utilized in.</p>

      <p><b>User Interviews and Surveys</b><br>
      We interviewed many people who participated in outdoor recreational activities, including Northeastern's outdoor club. One member of a Boy Scout Troop shared that his troop limited themselves to mountains with good cell reception because of safety concerns. They also had issues in the past finding groups that got lost because they didn't have good way to locate them quickly. In our interviews with guides of outdoor hiking expeditions, we confirmed that TrailTag would be a good way to communicate between the groups. These guides had PLBs for extreme emergencies in order to notify emergency response teams, but TrailTag could be helpful in preventing the need for a search and rescue altogether. After our interviews, we sent out surveys which confirmed that the high majority of people feel safer when they are able to communicate with the other people in their group.

      <p>Our last phase was styling our wireframes. We did many iterations to find the right blend of colors. Since there were so many different statuses a user could have (guide, in distress, out of range, etc.), it was particularly challenging choosing colors and styles for each of the indicators on the map. We wanted each of them to be easily distinguishable, without becoming too confusing.</p>
      </div>

  <div class="col-xl-4 col-sm-5 padding-right more-space-bottom-xs">
      <p>Our solution was to utilize three main colors&mdash; light blue for guides, teal for regular trip participants, and red for any signs of distress. We kept these colors consistent throughout the app, and used size and shadows to indicate any other changes in status on the map markers.</p></div>
