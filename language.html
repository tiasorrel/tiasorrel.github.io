        <h1>Language Barriers</h1>
        <p>This project simulates the experience of being immersed in a new language. Done in two parts (paper and web), it explores the issues that arise with language barriers, as well as the ways that people overcome these obstacles. I designed and coded the website. You can check it out <a class="p-link-pink" href="http://5dfundamentals.space/spring2017/thomson/https://tiasorrel.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>In my 5D Fundamentals class, I worked with two partners to create a guidance system to move another person (or group of people) through an environment with the goal of facilitating a specific kind of experience or heightened awareness of that environment. We chose to focus on language barriers, creating two separate experiences based on this theme.

      <h3>Paper Experience</h3>
      <p>For the paper part of this project, we created an activity in which one person would be directing another person to fill in the correct spots on a grid using only our made-up language. We provided a dictionary of terms that the explainer could use and an “answer key” that showed the grid with all of the correct spots filled in. Within the preset time limit, the blank grid was to be colored in to match the answer key— all without the explainer directly pointing to the grid or using any English.<br><br>This activity forced the participants to think of other ways to communicate. This included hand gestures and nodding. These imposed barriers, along with the stated time constraints, created a generally frustrating experience. The most interesting aspect was seeing which methods participants organically created as they went through the activity.</p>

      <p>The web experience focused on language barriers in regards to learning. My sister started school in the US when she was 8-years-old when we moved here from Taiwan. She quickly fell behind because English was not her native language. After years of feeling like the smartest kid in her class in Taiwan, she immediately felt like one of the dumbest. English skills are tests of intelligence in schools in the United States. I found an interesting piece of information while researching this topic: 72% of Americans say it is essential that immigrants living in the United States learn to speak English. Meanwhile, only 20% believe it is essential that Americans learn a second language other than English.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-5 padding-right">
      <p>Taking this into consideration, along with recent debate about allowing students speaking their native language in schools, we decided to create the experience of being immersed into a new language in an academic environment to show how difficult reading and oral comprehension can be if you don't fully understand the language being used.</p></div>

      <p><b>Starting Page</b><br>The very first page is simplistic and doesn't give away the upcoming obstacles that the user will face. It simply states: "This test is designed to evaluate your reading and oral comprehension skills." The fact that it is seemingly a test of knowledge is enough incentive for the user to want to do well in the upcoming quizzes.</p>

      <p><b>Reading Comprehension</b><br>The first part of the experience was a reading comprehension quiz in which certain words were replaced with gibberish to mimic trying to read English with only a limited vocabulary. A “notebook” area was provided for the user to take notes. The quiz questions tested their understanding and returned their scores upon submission.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10">
      <p><b>Oral Comprehension</b><br>The second part of the experience is similar to the first, but more difficult. Users now have to answer questions based on a passage that is being read out loud. Like the reading comprehension section, certain words are replaced with gibberish, hindering users’ understanding of the passage. After submitting the test scores, the total results are tallied and shown as a letter grade.</p>

This final page allows the user to come up with their own conclusion of the experience.</p>
