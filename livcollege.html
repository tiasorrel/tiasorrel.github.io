        <h1>LivCollege</h1>
        <p>LivCollege is a web application that pairs prospective students with current college students for personalized tours of the campus and its culture. With my Scout team, we created a brand identity and logo for the company, researched and specified product requirements, and designed a high-fidelity prototype.</p>

      <h3>Branding</h3>
      <p>We completed an intensive branding exercise with the client in which we discussed topics such as symbols, perception, experience, and promise. With the client's vision in mind, we then set out to create a logo to encompass LivCollege's brand. At the end, we delivered our client a Brand Book explaining all of the brand guidelines that we had designed and incorporated into the Hi-fi mockups.<br><br></p></div>

      <h3>Web Application Design</h3>
      <p>The three actors for this application are prospective students, current college students who host the day visits (hosts), and the administration of each college that offers this service (admin). We had to design the site for each of the three groups, keeping the design style consistent throughout and thoughtfully including specific features in each portal to elicit the greatest functionality.<br><br></p>

      <p><b>User Flows and Paper Prototyping<br></b>
      As a team, we worked a lot on the whiteboard during our meetings. We created user flows for each of the actors and decided which features were necessary for a MVP. A specific challenge that came up was how we wanted to design the prospective student-host pairing system. Many questions arose: <em>Should the prospective student be able to see all of the hosts at a college? How much information should be on their profiles? Would prospective students rather find their perfect host and schedule a visit according to the host's available dates, or find a host based on their availability?</em></p>

      <p><b>Wireframes</b><br>
      In our wireframes, we tested out various solutions. We uploaded our wireframes onto Invision and used hotspots to show the app's functionality. Working on Invision's platform also allowed our team to provide a lot of feedback in order to create the optimal user experience. Once our wireframes were finished and approved, we moved on to adding branding elements and color in the high-fidelity prototypes. </p>

      In our hi-fi mock-ups, we took our existing wireframes and jazzed them up. We added color, typeface selection, icons, and hover-states. We focused on keeping everything consistent throughout the application. These intensively designed and detailed prototypes were delivered to our client at the end of the semester in excellent shape to be handed to a developer, alongside our extensively-detailed requirements book. </p>

      <p>I designed a requirements book to consolidate all of the web development elements into a single document. This book included the site map, data dictionary, use cases for each of the three possible 'portals' of the site (administrative, host, and prospective student), and lastly, state diagrams.</p>

      <p><b>Site Map</b><br>I helped to draft this site map, and then I created a layout for it as part of the requirements book. It is a 'big picture' view of the web app, showing the main organization of the product and the relationships between content components.</p>

      <p><b>Data Dictionary</b><br>This dictionary lists and defines the terms that are use throughout the requirements book. Many are terms that we had adopted casually to refer to certain users or parts of the app. Since our client was planning on handing this off to an outside developer, we wanted to make sure that the rest of the requirements book was clear and understandable by defining our commonly used terms.</p>

      <p><b>Use Cases</b><br>I drafted these use cases to reflect any action that a user might want to accomplish on the site. (For example, for the use case shown: As a prospective student, I would like to set up my profile so I can be matched to a host with similar interests.) I created use cases for each actor- host, prospective student, and admin, and explained the Preconditions, Basic Path, Variations (if any), and Post-Conditions for each use case. I also added thumbnails of each web page mentioned in the Basic Path or Variations sections as step-by-step visuals. In total, there were 65 use cases included in this requirements book spanning all three actors. Here, I'm showing just one.
