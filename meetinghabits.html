        <h1>MeetingHabits</h1>
        <p>As project lead and designer for this project, I led a small team of student designers through the design and development of a brand identity, print material, and a completely responsive marketing website, which is live at <a class="p-link-pink" href="http://meetinghabits.com" target="_blank">meetinghabits.com</a>.</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>MeetingHabits is a simple way to improve meetings. The service promotes a new smart meeting habit every month. Employees can track their progress and view their data to see how they and the rest of their company are improving. This data motivates teams, helping companies save time and money, thus improving workplace efficiency.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xl-4 col-sm-5 padding-right">
      <h3>Research and Discovery</h3>
      <p>The first part of any design project is planning and research. We worked with our client to understand his mission and gather project requirements. This process helps articulate the problem, identify the audience, and set achievable goals for the project, laying the foundation for the phases ahead. The main deliverable for this phase was the creative brief, in which I outlined the company's goals, audience, and key questions.</p>

      <h3>Branding</h3>
      <p>We started our branding process by completing a few branding exercises with our client. By doing branding exercises, we learned to think about the brand as if it was a person, noting all of the nuances, contradictions, and complexities. The process encouraged us to dig deeper and move beyond words such as "cool" or "modern" and lean towards words like “analytical” and “relatable.” To get to our final brand star (only 5 key attributes), it took a lot of discussion and having to ask our client, “What do you mean by that?” in order to get to the heart of MeetingHabits. In the end, the aspects of our brand star has some tension, which just makes the brand that much more interesting and distinct. Throughout the rest of the project, this brand star served as our North Star, guiding us through our design decisions.<br><br></p></div>

      <p><b>Logo</b><br>
      After many different versions and iterations, we chose this simple design. The icon represents checking something off a list, evoking a feeling of productivity and efficiency. The typeface is a mix of soft curves and harsher angles, which we felt captured the voice of our brand-- helpful and relatable (soft), yet analytical (angular).</p>

      <p><b>Posters</b><br>These posters below were designed for companies using MeetingHabits to hang up in their conference rooms as reminders of the month's habit. In our final posters, we decided on using bright, eye-catching colors. We expanded from our existing color scheme from our website designs to incorporate more of a rainbow of colors-- each habit would have its own color.</p></div>

      <h3>Marketing Website</h3>
      <p>We designed and developed a marketing website for the product in order to show the benefits of adopting MeetingHabits, provide a clear description of how the product works, and give customers various ways to reach out if interested. Throughout the semester, we came up with several different versions of each website page to make sure the user experience helped our client accomplish his goals.<br><br>Check out the full site <a href="http://meetinghabits.com" class="p-link-red">here</a>!

       <div style="padding-left: 35px;" class="border-red"><p>Since the product was actively being tested and vetted with a beta client, we had to convey how the product worked as abstractly as possible to keep the marketing site relevant as the product underwent changes.</p></div>

      <h3>What We Learned</h3>
      <p><b>Encouraging constructive conversations:</b> As a team of young designers, challenging someone else’s opinion could often feel intimidating. Getting over that fear led to better quality work.<br><br>

      <b>Client relations:</b> Keeping our client updated throughout the week outside of our weekly meetings ensured that there would be no big surprises when we were presenting him our work. Regular communication with him was essential to the success of this project to make sure that everybody was always on the same page.<br><br>

      <b>Having fun:</b> Lastly, cultivating friendships within our team created a fun and encouraging working environment for our project. Being able to all bond, laugh and joke around made it much easier to have open and honest discussions about our work.</p>
